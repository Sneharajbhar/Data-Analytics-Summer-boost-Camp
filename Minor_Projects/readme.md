## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 🧮 Calculator

A simple console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

#### 🔧 Features:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Modulus (Remainder)
- Division
- Floor Division
- Exponentiation

#### 📌 How it works:
- The user is prompted to input two numbers.
- A menu is displayed with operation options.
- Based on the selected option, the corresponding result is displayed.

### 2. 🔐 Password Login System

A simple password authentication system to simulate basic user login functionality.

#### 🔧 Features:
- Hardcoded password for access: `Sneha036`
- Allows a maximum of 3 attempts
- Displays number of remaining attempts after each failure

#### 📌 How it works:
- The user is asked to enter a password.
- If correct, access is granted.
- If incorrect, the user gets up to 3 tries before being locked out.

### 3. 💳 Mini ATM Simulation

A minimal ATM-like simulation focusing on depositing and withdrawing money.

#### 🔧 Features:
- Input deposit amount
- Option to withdraw money
- Ensures withdrawal amount is ≥ 500 and ≤ deposited balance
- Displays remaining balance if transaction is successful

#### 📌 How it works:
- User deposits a certain amount.
- User is asked whether they wish to withdraw.
- Withdrawals are validated based on rules (minimum ₹500, must be within balance).
