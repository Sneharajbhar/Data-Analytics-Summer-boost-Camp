## 🙏 Acknowledgements

- The Spotify Dashboard project was inspired and guided by tutorials from the following YouTube channel:
  [Data Tutorials – Power BI Project | Advanced Power BI Project | Power BI Tutorial 2025 | Start to End Analysis Part 1](https://youtu.be/D4swB6z8mC4?si=VAVAKuljS9c-pEHe)

This resource helped us understand how to visualize music data using Power BI and Python.


Thank You!!!
